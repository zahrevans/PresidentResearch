                <p>
                  Andrew Jackson is born in Waxhaw, S.C., the third child of
                  Andrew Jackson, Sr., and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson. Former
                  linen weavers, Jackson's parents immigrated to the U.S. from
                  northern Ireland in 1765, part of a larger Scotch-Irish
                  trans-Atlantic migration. They established a small log-cabin
                  homestead in Carolina mountain country near Twelve Mile Creek.
                  Andrew Jackson, Sr., died shortly before the birth of his
                  namesake son. Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, left a widow with
                  the care of three young boys, moves to the nearby home of her
                  sister and brother-in-law, the slaveholding farmers Jane and
                  James Crawford.

                  Jackson runs in the presidential election as a

                  electoral vote over his leading opponent, John Quincy Adams of
                  Massachusetts, but not the majority electoral vote necessary
                  to be declared the victor. Under the terms of the 12th
                  Amendment, the U.S. House of Representatives will decide which
                  of the top three candidates will occupy the presidency.
